Absolutely, here's a simplified list of the steps to dynamically display role-based content on your website:

1. **Create Role-Based Dashboard Pages:**
   Create separate dashboard pages for students, faculty, and potentially other roles (e.g., admin).
   - `student_dashboard.php`
   - `faculty_dashboard.php`
   - `admin_dashboard.php`

2. **Determine User Role and Redirect:**
   Modify your login script to identify the user's role and redirect them to their respective dashboard page based on the role.

3. **Display Role-Based Content:**
   In each dashboard page, display content specific to the user's role. Customize the content, layout, and features for each role.
   
4. **Enhance Role-Based Functionality:**
   As your website grows, expand the features available on each dashboard page, providing useful tools and information tailored to each role.

5. **Secure Role-Based Access:**
   Ensure proper security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access to role-specific pages and functionalities.

6. **User-Friendly Messaging:**
   Consider adding personalized messages, notifications, and guidance on each dashboard page to enhance user experience.

Remember that this is an iterative process. You can start with basic functionality and gradually enhance it based on user feedback and requirements. Good luck with your website development! If you need further assistance or explanations for any specific step, feel free to ask.
